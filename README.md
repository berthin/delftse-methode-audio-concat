# delftse-methode-audio-concat

Simple script to concatenate the audio files from the Delftse methode 5editie

Download the audio files from https://www.nt2school.nl/nl/lesmateriaal/nederlands-voor-buitenlanders-5e-editie/boek, unzip them and run the script. This will generate
audio files per each text with 2 seconds gap between each sentence, this makes easier to follow the text/conversation, otherwise, without gaps, it's very difficult to
understand the beginning of each sentence..
